## HME Develop Stage Plan
### Pre-DVT Phase
* New part/modify part tooling DFM, tooling fabrication, tooling tuning and verification.
* DOEs to be arranged and done to verify the adjusted design for part/FG level and the optic test stations during the pre-DVT phase. Aggressive rel. test items pre-test required.
* Rel. test waiver/test criteria adjustment to be proposed by TL based on EVT 1 test result.
* New design optic function engineering verification plan proposed and test done by TL, and results approved by HK.
* Online FG optic inspection test method & criteria to be proposed by TL based on new design/requirement and approved by HK.
* TL to propose function control plan for part/sub-assy./FG level. Latest aligned optic function control SIPs are available, TL to propose updates, and HK to approve for DVT. Golden/Limit sample for function test to be prepared by TL, and to be signed by HK before DVT build.
* Part/assembly “检验规程” available. TL to propose updates according to design updates. “Cosmetic & Inspection Specification” is available. Extra needed cosmetic limit sample to be prepared by TL, and to be signed by HK for DVT build. 
### DVT Build
* Build quantity to be proposed by TL. DVT sample quantity needs to cover all rel. test and golden/limit sample for PVT. If any extra sample for marketing or other purposes required need to be defined by HK. 
* Rel. test to be done and test result to be reviewed. Extra waiver to be approved by HK if needed.
* New function test golden/Limit sample for PVT to be selected from DVT sample by TL and signed by HK if test criteria need to be adjusted.
* New cosmetic limit sample for PVT to be selected from DVT sample by TL and signed by HK if needed.
### PVT Build
* Build quantity to be provided by HK.
